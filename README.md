# StackQueue


## Purpose

The StackQueue, also referred to as Squeue, is a data structure that combines the functionalities of both a Stack and a Queue. It allows new elements to be added, removed, and peeked at both ends of the list, making it versatile for various data manipulation scenarios.


## Execution

- Compile the code using the provided Makefile by running the following command in the terminal: `make`

- Once the compilation is successful, run the squeue program using the following command: `./squeue`


# Files Included

The StackQueue (Squeue) data structure is implemented across the following files:

- squeue.h: This header file contains function prototypes for the StackQueue data structure, implemented in squeue.c.

- squeue.c: This source file contains the definitions of all the functions declared in squeue.h. It is the main implementation file for the StackQueue data structure.

- squeue_client.c: This source file contains the main function and necessary includes (<stdio.h>, <assert.h>, <stdlib.h>, and "squeue.h"). It serves as the entry point to execute the StackQueue program.

- Makefile: This Makefile correctly compiles and links the code in the above three files into an executable called squeue. It also includes a clean target to remove generated files.
